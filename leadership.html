            "Leaders perceive future outcomes to proactively react to present situations while in contrast managers aim for stability and try to solve the problem by executing existing ways." [1]
          </p>

          <p>
            Leadership is known as “the process of influencing the activities of an organized group in its efforts towards goal setting and goal achievement.” [2]

          <p>Leadership is a skill that a person must exhibit to be successful in every aspect of his/her life. Leadership skills are necessary whenever there is a group of people involved, small or big, for example, running a family, running a company or running a country. Any group without a good leader is doomed to collapse and fail. There is a popular misconception that “Leaders are born, not made”. But on the contrary, most of the great leaders of this world became great through hard work and experience. The ability to effectively lead, motivate and direct a group of people – whether it is in business, sport or politics - requires a very complex set of skills, mostly acquired through experiences, self development as well as access to subsequent training.</p>
          <br>
          <p>When it comes to Software Engineering, it is often associated with hard-skills such as programming, debugging, testing, and so on. While that is true to some extent, it cannot be ignored that soft skills are also vital to software engineering as a discipline. Leadership in software engineering can be in many forms - teamlead, project manager, product manager, etc. This document explores the various aspects of how leadership skills are important in software engineering.</p>

        <h2>Role of Academia/Industry</h2>

      <div class="row content">

          <p>
            <strong>Academia: </strong>The computer science or software engineering curriculum in most of universities are primarily focused on the hard/technical skills and soft skills are mostly ignored.
            The fact that most of the academic projects do not have a designated leader proves that leadership skills are not given much attention in academia.
            <br><br>
            However, every academic team project I have come across usually has an unsaid leader. He/she is not voted as a leader by the team or picked by the teacher as a team leader, but will be doing most of the
            works that a leader does. This can include calling project meetings, asking and reporting on progress, getting in touch with the teacher to clarify requirements, and so on. Showing such traits in multiple academic
            projects one after another can really help develop leadership skills in a student.
            <br><br>
            This example alone shows that, although, the academic curriculum does not give much attention to developing leadership skills, one can attain it by acting as a leader in academic projects.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
          <p>
            <strong>Industry: </strong>In the above section about four tech leaders, three of them were high-school/college dropouts. Using these examples, it can fairly be said that these great tech leaders culminated their leadership
            skills through hardships in the industry rather than during their time in academic institutions.
            <br><br>
            There are two ways to attain leadership in industry. The first one being starting as a developer and rising above the ranks as shown above in Roles section - technical lead, team lead, engineering manager and so on. This is a long
            process and does not always guarantee the top position. However, you can still develop valuable leadership skills staying at the lower levels and leading the team at that level. One does not always need to be at a top management
            position to be a good leader.
            <br><br>
            The next way is to do what the tech leaders mentioned in the above section did - become an entrepreneur and start your own company. This way you can really develop your leadership skills.

            <p>Leadership skill is a soft-skill and comes with experience and practice. There are no software, programs or tools that you can use particularly to improve your leadership skills. If you want to be a good Python programmer, you
              can improve your programming skills by learning new frameworks, writing more code and keep practicing, which is not the case with leadership skills. It is however necessary that a leader at a particular level or in a particular role
              be familiar with the tools being used by his peers or subordinates. For example, a technical lead or team lead must be familiar with the programming languages, APIs, frameworks, etc. that his/her team is using for the project.
              <br><br>
              Measuring leadership skills are difficult to quantify and measure but there are some assessment tools that one can use. The most famous one is the <a href = "https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) </a>[9] which can help a person identify their leadership styles.
              Another similar assessment tool is the <a href = "https://www.discprofile.com/what-is-disc/how-disc-works/">DiSC </a>profile which measures your tendencies and preferences — your patterns of behavior [10].
              <br><br>
              These tools are somewhat helpful to identify leadership skills or traits in a person but do not tell you how to achieve those skills. Therefore, one must practice the skills mentioned in the
              Prerequisites section to become an effective leader.

                I believe I have the necessary prerequisites such as technical skills, decision making skills, etc. to be an effective leader. I have acted as a leader in numerous academic projects
                during my undergraduate and graduate studies. I have also worked as a backend developer for three years in a software company during which I have seen and observed how my team leads, managers
                and directors operated the team and the department itself. However, since I have not acted as a leader at any level in a software industry, I know that I have a lot yet to learn which is why I think
                a score of 7 justifies my leadership skills.
